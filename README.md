# E-commerce Backend

## Task Description
  In this task I was asked to complete the backend of a CRUD application featuring an example of an e-comerce backend. In order to complete this I had to generate the routes associated with categories, prodcuts, tags, and their associated IDs. In order to display a working backend, I utilized insomnia in order to display each and every route for all three categories. Finally I was able to insert the seed data into the backend to give us a display of the moving parts of the entirety of the back end.
